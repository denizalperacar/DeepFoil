# Airfoil_Generator
Using CST I will generate valid and invalid airfoils database. The CST will generate random airfoils The I will analyse them using Xfoil. The ones analysed are considered as valid airfoils. 

Then I will train an autoencoder on those airfoils. 
My first objective is to create a 2D latent space and if its not feasible I will try a 3D , and ...

At the end I will compare the location of other airfoils in the latent space and see if there is any correlation.
